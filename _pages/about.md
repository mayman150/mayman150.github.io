I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree at the University of Alberta under the supervision of Professor [Marlos C. Machado](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~machado/). My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a particular interest in addressing the plasticity challenge in continual RL.

Previously, I conducted a research internship on 3D Computer Vision, specifically composition learning, at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the supervision of Prof.[Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/people/person/mohamed-elhoseiny). Also, I worked at data distillation of NLP datasets as an intern at Microsoft Research. During my undergraduate program, I focused on optimizing Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for billion-scale NLP datasets and supporting filter-search.
